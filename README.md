## Overview of the Analysis
    Based on recent analysis to discover retiring employees in the coming years, our team was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

### Purpose
    The client has a significant number of employees retiring in the coming years, a phenomena that the client has dubbed "The Silver Tsunami". Our goal is to identify all employees approaching retirement, identify operational titles and potential vacancies, and identify retirees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will aid the client in prioritizing the positions that would benefit most from experiential learning with a mentor.
